This is a program which calculates the CGPA of an Engineering student in NIE and any Engineering student whose college has the same CGPA system as that of our college.
The main points to be remembered here are that there are three parts:
1) One credit courses.
2) Three credit courses.
3) Four credit courses.

These files are made with the purpose of dividing the program by three parts.
Points to remember:
1) One credit course do not contain any SEE hencehey have a separate criteria.
2) All three credit and four credit courses have SEE and they are somewhat similar in evaluation.
3) The difference in three and four credit course is the credits that it is multiplied to.

Note: This is for 1 year students has of now. It's credibility will be checked later once the main graduation course continues.
